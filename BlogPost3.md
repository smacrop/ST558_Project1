In this project I wrote a function to connect with the Movie API
[here](http://www.omdbapi.com/) and return parsed data in a dataframe.
The most difficult part of the project was pulling, committing, and
pushing etc. with git. I have never done any of that before but I think
Iâ€™m getting the hang of it. In the future I would allow myself more time
for staring at stackexchange until I come up with ways around my
problem(s).
